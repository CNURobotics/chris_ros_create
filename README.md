This is a simplified packaging of the ROS-based iRobot Create model and control system.

The code is based on the 2.3.0 version of Turtlebot software (https://github.com/turtlebot)

This version uses a TwistStamped.msg for the velocity command as opposed to the Twist.msg in the original.
This repository contains the node for the actual robot as well as Gazebo simulation setup.
